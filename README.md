### Python Basics

#### [Variables](./variables)

Python Variable is containers that store values. Python is not “statically typed”. We do not need to declare variables before using them or declare their type. A variable is created the moment we first assign a value to it. A Python variable is a name given to a memory location.

* Rules for Python variables

    1. A Python variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
    2. A Python variable name cannot start with a number.
    3. A Python variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
    4. Variable in Python names are case-sensitive (name, Name, and NAME are three different variables).
    5. The reserved words(keywords) in Python cannot be used to name the variable in Python.

#### Data Types

Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are classes and variables are instances (objects) of these classes. The following are the standard or built-in data types in Python:

1. Numeric
2. Sequence Type
3. Boolean
4. Set
5. Dictionary
6. Binary Types( memoryview, bytearray, bytes)
