Let me explain the syntax of the Python for loop better.

The first word of the statement starts with the keyword “for” which signifies the beginning of the for loop.
Then we have the iterator variable which iterates over the sequence and can be used within the loop to perform various functions
The next is the “in” keyword in Python which tells the iterator variable to loop for elements within the sequence
And finally, we have the sequence variable which can either be a list, a tuple, or any other kind of iterator.
The statements part of the loop is where you can play around with the iterator variable and perform various function
