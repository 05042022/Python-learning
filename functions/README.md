The following snippet shows the general syntax to define a function in Python:

```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # What the function does goes here
    return result 
```

1. You need to use the def keyword, give your function a name, followed by a pair of parentheses, and end the line with a colon (:).
2. If your function takes arguments, the names of the arguments (parameters) are mentioned inside the opening and closing parentheses.
3. Please note that in function definition, the arguments that your function consumes are referred to as parameters.
When you call the function with specific values for these parameters, they're called arguments or actual parameters. This is because the arguments in the function call are the values used for the function's parameters.
4. Then, you begin an indented block. This is the body of the function that describes what your function does.
5. There's a return statement that returns the result of the operation on the arguments. The return statement returns control to the point where the function was originally called.

> Note that the arguments and the return statement are optional. This means that you could have a function that takes in no arguments, and returns nothing.
